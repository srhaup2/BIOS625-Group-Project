# StackOverflow Answer Quality Prediction

This is the final project for the class Biostat 625 - Computing with Big Data. The dataset we used consists of StackOverflow questions and answers for R programming. Our objective was to extract information from the text data to see if we could predict answer acceptance and score. We used several big data techniques along the way (parallelization, cluster computing) to make working with this ~0.5MB dataset manageable. You can find a writeup of our results in the `final_report.pdf` file, and our code is in the `R` folder.
